This project presents a Visual Studio solution including a simple demo ASP.Net Web API Service Application and a “Tester” Client (Windows Form Application) that allows the user to test the Web API with CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). In addition to demonstrating standard CRUD capabilities, the Web API service implements a .Net Memory Cache (MemoryCache). The client “tester” application also allows the user to verify that the memory cache is implemented correctly and expiring per the set policy. Discussion of the memory cache implementation may help the reader with tips to understand, correctly implement, and verify the cache is expiring. Lastly, the project is shown in the demo section with a video and screen captures.
